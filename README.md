# nav2_minimal_turtlebot_simulation

A minimum description & simulation of the TB3/TB4 using standard ROS-GZ tools for ``nav2_bringup`` and user example.

It is largely ROS distribution agnostic, using launch files and URDFs so it should be easy to use for any ROS 2 distribution & release into Rolling for all future ones.
