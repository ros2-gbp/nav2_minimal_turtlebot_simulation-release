# Nav2 Minimal Turtlebot4 Description

This is a minimum description for the Turtlebot4 for use with Nav2. This is setup to strip out external dependencies and complexities of the iRobot Create3 & TB4 ignition simulation panels to the bare minimum needed for simulating the robot for Nav2's bringup which hopefully will not require changes from distribution-to-distribution.
